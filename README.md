# Retail EDA
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the retail domain using the "Sample Superstore" dataset. The dataset provides valuable insights into sales, customer information, and product details from a fictional retail store. The goal of this EDA is to analyze and understand the data, discover patterns, relationships, and actionable insights that can help improve business strategies.

# Dataset Information
The "Sample Superstore" dataset consists of the following columns:

    1. Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
    2. Order Date: The date when the order was placed.
    3. Ship Date: The date when the order was shipped.
    4. Ship Mode: The shipping method used for the order (e.g., Standard, Second Class, First Class, etc.).
    5. Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
    6. Customer Name: Name of the customer.
    7. Segment: The customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

# EDA Goals
During the exploratory data analysis, we aim to achieve the following objectives:
    1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
    2. Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and distributions of numerical features.
    3. Data Visualization: Create insightful visualizations (e.g., bar plots, scatter plots, histograms) to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
    4. Customer Segmentation: Analyze customer segments based on sales, location, and other attributes.
    5. Product Analysis: Explore popular products, product categories, and their impact on sales and profits.
    6. Time-Series Analysis: Investigate sales trends and seasonality over time.
